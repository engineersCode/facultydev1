## Funded participants

### Jeremy Abramson

[Jeremy](https://www.isi.edu/people/abramson/about) is a Research Computer Scientist at The University of Southern California’s Information Sciences Institute, and a lecturer in USC’s Data Science program. He uses Jupyter extensively for lectures and labs in his data science courses at USC. When he’s not teaching or working in cybersecurity research, he’s probably dabbling in his true passion, sports analytics. He recently taught a course in sports analytics (using Jupyter!) in UCLA’s Master of Science in Business Analysis program, and is looking to extend those lectures into a textbook.

### Jesse Oldroyd

Jesse is assistant professor of mathematics at West Virginia Wesleyan College. 
He teaches lower and upper division undergraduate mathematics courses, and recently started incorporating tools such as Jupyter notebooks in some courses, both for lecture notes and class activities. He is particularly interested in creating interactive materials that serve as "lab manuals" to illustrate and expand on concepts from lecture.

### David Proctor 

David is adjunct faculty in chemistry at Saginaw Valley State University and Mid Michigan College, where he teaches introductory, general and organic chemistry. Previously, he was a Scientific Review Officer with CSRA Inc., where he managed peer review for the Congressionally Directed Medical Research Programs, and a AAAS Science & Technology Policy Fellow working on scientific software infrastructure at the National Science Foundation.  He is currently exploring Jupyter Notebooks as a platform for engaging students.
