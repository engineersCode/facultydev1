## Funded participants

### Bernard Badzioch

[Bernard](http://www.buffalo.edu/cas/math/people/faculty/badzioch.html) is an associate professor of mathematics, University at Buffalo. 
He recently created the course ["Introduction to Linear Algebra"](https://learning.buffalo.edu/courses/course-v1:UBx+MTH309+2019_FA/course/) using Jupyter notebooks in the BUx Open edX platform. 
His materials are also available [on Github](https://github.com/bbadzioch/MTH309_F2019).

### Francesca Bernardi

[Francesca](http://www.fbernardi.info) is currently dean's post-doctoral scholar in the Department of Mathematics at Florida State University. 
She is starting a tenure-track position in Mathematics with affiliation in Mechanical Engineering at the Worcester Polytechnic Institute next Fall.

### Ryan Cooper

[Ryan](https://me.engr.uconn.edu/blog/faculty/cooper-ryan/) is assistant professor-in-residence at the University of Connecticut Department of Mechanical Engineering. 
He is now teaching computational mechanics using Jupyter, and his course materials are available [on GitHub](https://github.uconn.edu/rcc02007/Computational_Mechanics).

### Drew Youngren

[Drew](https://drew.youngren.nyc) is lecturer of applied mathematics at Columbia University. 
He is now teaching Multivariable Calculus for Engineers and Applied Scientists.

### Sara Hashmi

[Sara]() is an Assistant Professor of Chemical Engineering at Northeastern University

### Sally Lucci

[Sally](https://medicine.hsc.wvu.edu/who-we-are/faculty-staff/sally-lucci/) is the founding program director and an assistant professor in health informatics and information management at West Virginia University. 
She had a long career in health care, before pivoting to her current teaching role in an undergraduate degree that combines business with science and information technology. 

### Kyle Niemeyer

[Kyle](https://niemeyer-research-group.github.io) is an assistant professor at the Oregon State University School of Mechanical, Industrial, and Manufacturing Engineering. His research interests are in computational modeling for fluid mechanics, combustion and chemical kinetics, and related topics like numerical methods and parallel computing. 
He is a co-organizer of this workshop. 

### Stephanos (Steve) Matsumoto

[Steve](https://www.stevematsumoto.net) is an Assistant Professor of Computer Science and Engineering at the Olin College of Engineering. His research interests are broadly in security and privacy. Steve is especially interested in how we can make practical changes that improve the security of widely-used technology. He is also interested in computing education, particularly in how to build a security mindset in students, as well as how to help students develop good software engineering habits and ethical practices in their work.

### Jesse Oldroyd

Jesse is assistant professor of mathematics at West Virginia Wesleyan College.

### Steve Singleton

[Steve](https://www.coe.edu/academics/majors-areas-study/chemistry/faculty) is a professor of chemistry at Coe College and contributor to the POGIL project. He has incorporated computing in undergraduate teaching of quantum mechanics, kinetics, and thermodynamics since the 1900s, but in recent years has adopted Python/Jupyter for the classroom. Python is also used by his research students for data analysis, instrument control, and computational chemistry.

### Julie Smith

[Julie](https://www.linkedin.com/in/julie-smith-25b073184/) is a curriculum developer, now pursuing a PhD in learning technologies at the University of North Texas. 

### Bryan Weber

[Bryan](https://bryanwweber.com) is assistant professor in residence and director of undergraduate studies at the University of Connecticut department of mechanical engineering. His research interests are in combustion of biofuels, computational analysis of reaction mechanisms for combustion, and software tools for combustion research and thermodynamics. 
He is a co-organizer of this workshop. 

### Patrick White

Patrick teaches mathematics and artificial intelligence at the Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and technology.

### Benjamin Woolson

[Brian](https://coe.northeastern.edu/people/woolston-benjamin/) is an assistant professor of chemical engineering at Northeastern University. 
He teaches a course in Bioprocess Engineering, where he uses Jupyter notebook to introduce his students to Python tools for analysis and design of biological processes. His course materials are [on GitHub](https://github.com/NUChemE/chme5630).
