## Funded participants

### Bernard Badzioch

[Bernard](http://www.buffalo.edu/cas/math/people/faculty/badzioch.html) is an associate professor of mathematics, University at Buffalo. 
He recently created the course ["Introduction to Linear Algebra"](https://learning.buffalo.edu/courses/course-v1:UBx+MTH309+2019_FA/course/) using Jupyter notebooks in the BUx Open edX platform. 
His materials are also available [on Github](https://github.com/bbadzioch/MTH309_F2019).

### Francesca Bernardi

[Francesca](http://www.fbernardi.info) is currently dean's post-doctoral scholar in the Department of Mathematics at Florida State University. 
She is starting a tenure-track position in Mathematics with affiliation in Mechanical Engineering at the Worcester Polytechnic Institute next Fall.

### Ryan Cooper

[Ryan](https://me.engr.uconn.edu/blog/faculty/cooper-ryan/) is assistant professor-in-residence at the University of Connecticut Department of Mechanical Engineering. 
He is now teaching computational mechanics using Jupyter, and his course materials are available [on GitHub](https://github.uconn.edu/rcc02007/Computational_Mechanics).

### Drew Youngren

[Drew](https://drew.youngren.nyc) is lecturer of applied mathematics at Columbia University. 
He is now teaching Multivariable Calculus for Engineers and Applied Scientists.
