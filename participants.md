## Funded participants

### Jeremy Abramson

[Jeremy](https://www.isi.edu/people/abramson/about) is a Research Computer Scientist at The University of Southern California’s Information Sciences Institute, and a lecturer in USC’s Data Science program. He uses Jupyter extensively for lectures and labs in his data science courses at USC.
