## Funded participants

### Bernard Badzioch

[Bernard](http://www.buffalo.edu/cas/math/people/faculty/badzioch.html) is an associate professor of mathematics, University at Buffalo.
He recently created the course ["Introduction to Linear Algebra"](https://learning.buffalo.edu/courses/course-v1:UBx+MTH309+2019_FA/course/) using Jupyter notebooks in the BUx Open edX platform.
His materials are also available [on Github](https://github.com/bbadzioch/MTH309_F2019).

### Francesca Bernardi

[Francesca](http://www.fbernardi.info) is currently dean's post-doctoral scholar in the Department of Mathematics at Florida State University. 
She is starting a tenure-track position in Mathematics with affiliation in Mechanical Engineering at the Worcester Polytechnic Institute next Fall. 
Francesca is the co-founder of [Girls Talk Math](https://girlstalkmath.com), a free summer camp for female and gender non-conforming high-school students interested in STEM and Media. The camp now has three locations at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, the University of Maryland at College Park, and the University of California Los Angeles. It includes curriculum built with Jupyter notebooks to learn about number systems, network science, and SIR modeling.

### Stephanos (Steve) Matsumoto

[Steve](https://www.stevematsumoto.net) is an Assistant Professor of Computer Science and Engineering at the Olin College of Engineering. His research interests are broadly in security and privacy. Steve is especially interested in how we can make practical changes that improve the security of widely-used technology. He is also interested in computing education, particularly in how to build a security mindset in students, as well as how to help students develop good software engineering habits and ethical practices in their work.

### Jesse Oldroyd

Jesse is assistant professor of mathematics at West Virginia Wesleyan College.

### Steve Singleton

[Steve](https://www.coe.edu/academics/majors-areas-study/chemistry/faculty) is a professor of chemistry at Coe College and contributor to the POGIL project. He has incorporated computing in undergraduate teaching of quantum mechanics, kinetics, and thermodynamics since the 1900s, but in recent years has adopted Python/Jupyter for the classroom. Python is also used by his research students for data analysis, instrument control, and computational chemistry.

### Julie Smith

[Julie](https://www.linkedin.com/in/julie-smith-25b073184/) is a curriculum developer, now pursuing a PhD in learning technologies at the University of North Texas.
She has worked in K12 education in various capacities for the last two decades. Relatively new to the field of computer science, her doctoral work is focused on computer science education. Her interests include improving curriculum for underrepresented students.

### Bryan Weber
